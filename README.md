# Ansible Role: Kibana

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/leifmadsen/ansible-role-kibana-4.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/leifmadsen/ansible-role-kibana-4)

An Ansible role that installs Kibana 4.x on Red Hat / CentOS or Debian /
Ubuntu.

## Requirements

This role was made to work with Nginx; other HTTP servers are not supported at
this time.

You'll also need the EPEL repository for access to the `python-passlib` library
when deploying on CentOS. You can enable the EPEL repository by adding the
`geerlingguy.repo-epel` role to your playbook.

## Role Variables

All available variables are listed below, along with their default values (see
`defaults/main.yml`).

    kibana_server_name: logs.example.tld

FQDN or IP address of the Kibana server.

    kibana_nginx_access_log: /var/log/nginx/kibana-4.access.log

Path and filename of the Nginx access log.

    kibana_version: 4.5

Major version of Kibana to install.

    kibana_username: kibana
    kibana_password: password

Kibana basic HTTP authentication username and password. You should update these
to be secure and not default.

    elasticsearch_url: http://localhost:9200

URL for connecting to the Elasticsearch service.

## Dependencies

* geerlingguy.nginx
